This comprehensive tutorial walks you through a real world application using React and Firebase. Whereas React is used to display your application in the browser and to store local state in components, Firebase will be used for authentication, authorization and a realtime database.

React beginners often wonder what's next after learning React. That's when I highly recommend people to get started with a advanced topics such as authentication, authorization and connecting your React application to a database. These are the fundamentals that real business applications need in the end. However, I don't want you to worry about implementing the backend application which manages everything yourself. A perfect alternative may be Firebase instead. I have seen people creating real businesses from zero to profitable with only React and Firebase; myself included. There was no need to implement a backend application with Node.js yourself. And that's what I want to teach you in this tutorial.

70% of the outcome of this tutorial can be checked out over {{% a_blank "here" "https://react-firebase-authentication.wieruch.com/" %}}. It doesn't included everything due to security reasons and because the remaining material can be found in the book.

In order to keep the guide updated, here is a list of the primary libraries and their versions which are used in this tutorial.

* React 16.6
* React Router 4
* Firebase 4

Please help me out if the tutorial needs any updates in order to keep it reliable for other people learning about the topic as well. In general, don't hesitate to point out improvements in the comments or visit the article directly on GitHub to open issues or pull requests.

{{% chapter_header "Requirements" "requirements" %}}

The requirements for this tutorial are a working [editor or IDE, a running command line](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/), and installed recent versions of {{% a_blank "node and npm" "https://nodejs.org/en/" %}}. In addition, you should have learned about React in the first place. [The Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/) is a free ebook which gives you all the fundamentals of React. You will build a larger application along the way in plain React and transition smoothly from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 and beyond. This tutorial will not dive into all the details taught in the ebook, so take the chance to grab your copy of it to learn about those first.

{{% chapter_header "React Application Setup: create-react-app" "react-application-setup" %}}

There are two ways to start out with this application. You can follow my guidance in this section or you can find a starter project in this {{% a_blank "GitHub repository" "hhttps://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication-starter-kit" %}} and follow its installation instructions.

The application we are going to build with React and Firebase will be set up with Facebook's official React boilerplate project called {{% a_blank "create-react-app" "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" %}}. You can install it once globally on the command line, and make use of it whenever you want afterward.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
npm install -g create-react-app
{{< /highlight >}}

After the installation, set up your project with it on the command line whereas the name for the project is up to you:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
create-react-app react-firebase-authentication
cd react-firebase-authentication
{{< /highlight >}}

Now you have the following command on your command line to start your application. You can start your application and visit it in the browser:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
npm start
{{< /highlight >}}

Now, we are going to setup the project for our needs. First of all, let's get rid of all the files of the bootstrapped React project that we are not going to use. From the command line in your *src/* folder type and execute:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
cd src
rm App.js App.test.js App.css logo.svg
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, create a *components/* folder in your application's *src/* folder on the command. That's where all your components will be implemented eventually. Also the App component that you have removed in the previous step will be recreated here.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
mkdir components
{{< /highlight >}}

Create for each component that we are going to implement for this application a dedicated folder:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
cd components
mkdir Account Admin App Home Landing SignIn SignOut SignUp
mkdir Navigation PasswordChange PasswordForget
mkdir Session Firebase
{{< /highlight >}}

In each folder, create an *index.js* file for the implementation of the component. Navigate into a folder, create the file, and navigate out again. Repeat it for every component. You can choose to name your folders/files differently, but that's how I liked to do it for my applications.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
cd App
touch index.js
cd ..
{{< /highlight >}}

Third, implement a basic component for each file you have created. For the App component in *src/components/App/index.js*, it could look like the following:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>App</h1>
  </div>
);

export default App;
{{< /highlight >}}

Fix the relative path to the App component in the *src/index.js* file. Since you have moved the App component, you need to add the */components* subpath to it.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=7" >}}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

serviceWorker.unregister();
{{< /highlight >}}

Last but not least, create one more folder in your *src/* folder:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
mkdir constants
{{< /highlight >}}

The folder should be located next to your *src/components/* folder. Move into the *src/constants/* folder and create two files that will be used for the routing and roles in a later point in time:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
cd constants
touch routes.js roles.js
cd ..
{{< /highlight >}}

Now everything is set up for this application. Run your application on the command line again. It should work and be accessible in the browser for you. Check again the starter project on GitHub that I have linked in the beginning of this section to verify whether you have set up everything properly.

### Exercises:

* Familiarize yourself with the folder structure of your project
* Optionally introduce a test for your App component and test the application yourself along the way
* Optionally introduce [CSS Modules](https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-css-modules/), [SASS](https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-with-sass-support/) or {{% a_blank "Styled Components" "https://www.styled-components.com" %}} and style the application yourself
* Optionally introduce [Git and keep track of your changes by having your project on GitHub](https://www.robinwieruch.de/git-essential-commands/)

{{% chapter_header "React Router, Routing and Routes" "react-router-setup" %}}

Since we are building a larger application in all the following sections, it would be great to have a couple of pages (e.g. landing page, account page, admin page, sign up page, sign in page) to split up the application into multiple URLs (e.g. /landing, /account, /admin). These URLs or subpaths of a domain are also called routes in a client-side web application. Therefore, let's implement the routing with {{% a_blank "React Router" "https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router" %}} before we dive into Firebase for the realtime database and authentication/authorization afterward. If you haven't used React Router before, don't worry and just follow my guidance in this section. You will have more time in the exercises of this section to learn React Router.

The application should have multiple routes. For instance, a user should be able to visit a landing page, but also the sign up and sign in pages to enter the application as an authenticated and authorized user. If a user is authenticated, it is possible to visit protected pages such as account or admin pages. Therefore, you can consolidate all the routes of your application in a well-defined *src/constants/routes.js* constants file:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
export const SIGN_UP = '/signup';
export const SIGN_IN = '/signin';
export const LANDING = '/';
export const HOME = '/home';
export const ACCOUNT = '/account';
export const ADMIN = '/admin';
export const PASSWORD_FORGET = '/pw-forget';
{{< /highlight >}}

Each route represents a page in your application. For instance, the sign up page should be reachable in development mode via *http://localhost:3000/signup* and later in production mode via *http://yourdomain/signup*. Let's walk through the routes step by step.

First of all, you will have a **sign up page** (register page) and a **sign in page** (login page). You can take any web application out there as the blueprint to structure these routes for a well-rounded authentication experience. For instance, take the following scenario: A user visits your web application. The user is convinced by your service and finds the button in the top-level navigation bar to sign in to your application. But the user has no account yet, so a sign up button is presented as an alternative on the sign in page.

{{% pin_it_image "react firebase login" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/sign.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}

Second, there will be a **landing page** and a **home page**. The landing page is your default route (e.g. *http://yourdomain/*). That's the place where a user ends up when visiting your web application. The user doesn't need to be authenticated to visit this route. On the other hand, the home page is a so-called **protected route**. The user can only access it as authenticated user. You will implement the protection of the route by using authorization mechanisms for this application.

Third, next to the **home page**, there will be protected **account page** and **admin page** as well. On the former page, a user can reset a password or change a password. It is secured by authorization as well, and thus only reachable for authenticated users. On the latter page, a user authorized as admin will be able to delete users. The admin page is protected on a more fine-grained level, because it is only accessible for authenticated admin users.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8 col-centered">
    {{% pin_it_image "react firebase account" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/account.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}
  </div>
</div>

Last but not least, the password forget component will be exposed on another non-protected page, a **password forget page**, as well. It is used for users who are not authenticated and forgot about their password.

{{% pin_it_image "react firebase password" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/password-reset.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}

That's all about the routes we are going to implement in this React with Firebase application. I find it pretty exciting to build this well-rounded application with you, because afterward you can use it to realize your ideas. You can build up on top of this boilerplate project that gives you authentication, authorization, and a database eventually.

Now all of these routes need to be accessible to the user. How to get started with the routing in React? First of all, you need a router to enable routing for your web application. The router is responsible to map routes to React components. React Router is a popular package to enable routing, so install it on the command line:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
npm install react-router-dom
{{< /highlight >}}

The best way to start is implementing a Navigation component which is used in the App component. The App component is the perfect place to render the Navigation component, because it will always render the Navigation component but replace the other components (pages) based on the routes. Basically, the App component is the container where all your fixed components are going (e.g. navigation bar, side bar, footer) but also your components which are displayed depending on the route in the URL (e.g. account page, login page, password forget page).

First, the App component will use the Navigation component that is not implemented yet. In addition, it uses the Router component provided by React Router. The Router makes it possible to navigate from URL-to-URL on the client-side application without making another request to a web server for every route change. The application is only fetched once from a web server, but then all routing is done on the client-side with React Router.

In *src/components/App/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 4 7 8 9" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

import Navigation from '../Navigation';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Navigation />
  </Router>
);

export default App;
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, implement the Navigation component. It uses the Link component of React Router to enable navigation to different routes. These routes were defined previously in your constants file. Let's import all of them and give every Link component a specific route.

In *src/components/Navigation/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 4 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const Navigation = () => (
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_IN}>Sign In</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.LANDING}>Landing</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.HOME}>Home</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.ACCOUNT}>Account</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.ADMIN}>Admin</Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default Navigation;
{{< /highlight >}}

Now, run your application again and verify two things: The links need to show up in your browser; and once you click a link, the URL has to change. However, notice that even though the URL changes, the displayed content doesn't change. The navigation is only there to enable navigation through your application. But no one knows what to render on each route. That's where the route to component mapping comes into play. In your App component, you can specify which components should show up according to corresponding routes with the help of the Route component from React Router.

In *src/components/App/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=4 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32" >}}
import React from 'react';
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
} from 'react-router-dom';

import Navigation from '../Navigation';
import LandingPage from '../Landing';
import SignUpPage from '../SignUp';
import SignInPage from '../SignIn';
import PasswordForgetPage from '../PasswordForget';
import HomePage from '../Home';
import AccountPage from '../Account';
import AdminPage from '../Admin';

import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <Navigation />

      <hr />

      <Route exact path={ROUTES.LANDING} component={LandingPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.SIGN_UP} component={SignUpPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.SIGN_IN} component={SignInPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.PASSWORD_FORGET} component={PasswordForgetPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.HOME} component={HomePage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.ACCOUNT} component={AccountPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.ADMIN} component={AdminPage} />
    </div>
  </Router>
);

export default App;
{{< /highlight >}}

If a route matches a path prop, the respective component will be displayed. Thus all the page components in the App component are exchangeable by changing the route, but the Navigation component stays fixed independently of any route change. That's how you enable a static frame that has various components (e.g. Navigation) around your dynamic pages driven by routes.

Previously, you have created basic components for each page component used by our routes. Now you should be able to start the application again. When you click through the links in the Navigation component, the displayed page component should change accordingly to the URL. Note that the routes for the PasswordForget and SignUp components are not used yet in the Navigation component but will be defined somewhere else later on. For now, you have successfully implemented the fundamental routing for this application.

### Exercises:

* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/d2a043d176fd840cf247cf83b3c13f8f9bf61500" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Firebase in React" "react-firebase" %}}

It's all about using Firebase in React for this application we are going to build together. Firebase, bought by Google in 2014, is your enabler for having a realtime database in React, for having extensive authentication and authorization, and even for deploying your application. You will be able to build real world applications with React and Firebase without worrying about implementing a backend application yourself. All the things a backend application would handle for you, authentication and a database, is taken care of by Firebase. There are plenty of businesses out there who are using React and Firebase to power their applications. It the ultimate combination to launch a {{% a_blank "MVP" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" %}}.

Take your time to sign up on the {{% a_blank "official Firebase website" "https://firebase.google.com/" %}}. After you have created an account on their platform, you should be able to create projects and you should have access to your project dashboard. Now, create a project for this application on their platform whereas the project can have any name. In the case of this application, run it on the free pricing plan. If you want to scale your application later on, you can change the plan.

Next, find the project's configuration in the settings on your dashboard. There you have access to all the necessary information: secrets, keys, ids and other details to set up your application. You will copy these in the next step to your React application.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8 col-centered">
    {{% pin_it_image "firebase config" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/firebase-config.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}
  </div>
</div>

Sometimes the Firebase website doesn't make it easy to find this page. Since it's moved around with every iteration of the website, I cannot give you any clear advice where to find it on your dashboard. But it is there, somewhere! Take it as an opportunity to get to know your Firebase project's dashboard while searching for this mysterious configuration.

{{% pin_it_image "firebase web settings" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/firebase-web-settings.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}

That's it for the Firebase website setup. Now you can return to your application in your editor/IDE to add the Firebase configuration. First, install Firebase for your application on the command line:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
npm install firebase
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, let's create a new file for the Firebase setup. We will use a JavaScript class to encapsulate all Firebase functionalities, realtime database and authentication, as a well-defined API for the rest of your application. You only need to instantiate the class once and can use it then to interact with the Firebase API. It's your custom Firebase interface.

Let's start with the configuration. Start by copying the configuration from your Firebase project's dashboard on their website to your application in a configuration object in a new In *src/components/Firebase/firebase.js* file. Make sure to replace the capitalized keys with the corresponding keys from your copied configuration:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
const config = {
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  authDomain: YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: YOUR_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: '',
  messagingSenderId: YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also use environment variables in React applications, but you have to use the `REACT_APP` prefix when you have used create-react-app to setup the application. If you are not using create-react-app, you can name them as you want.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 3 4 5 6 7" >}}
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};
{{< /highlight >}}

Now you can define the environment variables in a new *.env* file in your project's root folder. The *.env* file can also be added to your *.gitginore* file (in case you are using git), that your Firebase credentials are not exposed on a platform like GitHub.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
REACT_APP_API_KEY=XXXXxxxx
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxxXXXX.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=https://xxxXXXX.firebaseio.com
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=xxxxXXXX
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxxXXXX.appspot.com
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxxXXXX
{{< /highlight >}}

It's up to you to define the configuration inline or as environment variables. The latter is more secure and should be used when uploading your project to a version control system like GitHub. Let's continue with the Firebase setup. Import firebase from the earlier installed library. Then use it within your new Firebase class to initialize firebase with the configuration.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=1 12 13 14 15 16 18" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';

const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);
  }
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

That's it for the firebase configuration in your application. As optional step, you can create a second Firebase project on the Firebase website to have one project for your development environment and one project for your production environment. That way, you never mix up your data in the Firebase database from development mode with your data from your deployed application (production mode). If you decide to have projects for both environment, use the two configuration objects in your Firebase setup and decide depending on the development/production environment which one you take:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';

const prodConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROD_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

const devConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_DEV_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

const config =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? prodConfig : devConfig;

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);
  }
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

That's one way to do it. Another way would be to specify a dedicated *.env.development* and *.env.production* file for both kinds of environment variables in your project. Each file would be used to define environment variables for the matching environment. Then defining a configuration becomes straight forward again, because you don't have to select the correct configuration yourself.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';

const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);
  }
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

Whether you have used environment variables or defined the configuration inline, or whether you have used only one Firebase project or multiple projects for each environment (development, production), you have successfully configured Firebase for your React application. The next section will show you how a Firebase instance created from the Firebase class is used in React.

### Exercises:

* Read more about the {{% a_blank "Firebase Setup for Web Applications" "https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup" %}}
* Read more about {{% a_blank "Firebase's Pricing Plans" "https://firebase.google.com/pricing/" %}} to know better about the limitations of the free plan
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/65e6c18fb894b847fed0ab6f9bb042b310cfedc2" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Provide Firebase in React" "react-firebase-context-api" %}}

You have created a Firebase class but you are not using it yet in your React application. In this section, you are going to connect the Firebase with the React world. A straight forward approach would be to create a Firebase instance with the Firebase class and then import the instance (or class) in every React component where it's needed. That's not the best approach though, because of two reasons:

* It makes it more difficult to test your React components.
* It makes it more error prone, because Firebase should only be initialized once in your application ({{% a_blank "singleton" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" %}}) and by exposing the Firebase class to every React component, you could end up by mistake with multiple Firebase instances.

An alternative way would be to use [React's Context API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context-api/) to provide a Firebase instance only once at the top-level of your component hierarchy. Let's see how this approach works out for us. Create a new *src/components/Firebase/context.js* file in your Firebase module and provide the following implementation details:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

const FirebaseContext = React.createContext(null);

export default FirebaseContext;
{{< /highlight >}}

The `createContext()` function essentially creates two components: Whereas the `FirebaseContext.Provider` component will be used to provide a Firebase instance once at the top-level of your React component tree, which we will do in this section, the `FirebaseContext.Consumer` component is used somewhere in your application to retrieve the Firebase instance if it is needed in the React component. Now, in order to have a well-encapsulated Firebase module in our application, let's define a *index.js* file in our Firebase folder that exports all necessary functionalities (Firebase class, Firebase context for Consumer and Provider components):

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import FirebaseContext from './context';
import Firebase from './firebase';

export default Firebase;

export { FirebaseContext };
{{< /highlight >}}

Finally, the Firebase Context from the Firebase module (folder) can be used to provide a Firebase instance to your entire application in the *src/index.js* file. You only need to create the Firebase instance with the Firebase class and pass it as value prop to the React's Context:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=8 11 13" >}}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import './index.css';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

import App from './components/App';
import Firebase, { FirebaseContext } from './components/Firebase';

ReactDOM.render(
  <FirebaseContext.Provider value={new Firebase()}>
    <App />
  </FirebaseContext.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);

serviceWorker.unregister();
{{< /highlight >}}

Doing it this way, we can be assured that Firebase is only instantiated once and that it is injected via React's Context API to React's component tree. Now, every component that is interested in using Firebase has access to the Firebase instance with a `FirebaseContext.Consumer` component. Even though you will see it first-hand later for this application, the following code snippet shows how it would work:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

import  { FirebaseContext } from '../Firebase';

const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FirebaseContext.Consumer>
    {firebase => {
      return <div>I've access to Firebase and render something.</div>;
    }}
  </FirebaseContext.Consumer>
);

export default SomeComponent;
{{< /highlight >}}

Finally, both worlds, Firebase and React, are connected. It's the fundamental step to make both layers communicate to each other. Next we can start to implement the interface of the Firebase class on our side to communicate properly to the Firebase API.

### Exercises:

* Read more about [React's Context API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context-api/)
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/34d1887ecee83af0b3d2a51f4a7c78a55e2dabba" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Firebase's Authentication API" "firebase-authentication" %}}

In the previous section, you have created a Firebase project on the official Firebase website. This section will implement the interface of your Firebase class that enables communication between the class and the Firebase authentication API. In the sections afterward, you will use the interface of the Firebase class in your React components.

First, we need to activate one of the available authentication providers on Firebase's website. On your project's Firebase dashboard, you can find a menu item which says "Authentication". Select it and click "Sign-In Method" menu item afterward. There you can enable the authentication with Email/Password. Mainly we will cover the basic authentication with email and password here, but feel free to add other authentication methods (e.g. Facebook Sign-In) later.

{{% pin_it_image "firebase authentication providers" "img/posts/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/firebase-authentication-methods.jpg" "is-src-set" %}}

Second, we will implement the authentication API for our Firebase class. Import and instantiate the package from Firebase that is responsible for all the authentication in your *src/components/Firebase/firebase.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 17" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
  }
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

Now, let's define all the authentication functions step by step. They are our communication channel from the Firebase class to the Firebase API. First, the sign up function (registration): It takes email and password parameters for its function signature and uses an official Firebase API endpoint to create a user.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=13 15 16" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, the sign in function (login function) which takes email and password parameters, as well:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=18 19" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignInWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

At this point, note that these endpoints are called asynchronously. They need to be resolved later on. In addition, there needs to be error handling for it. For instance, it is not possible to sign in a user who is not signed up yet. The Firebase API would return an error.

Third, the sign out function (logout function). You don't need to pass any argument to it, because the Firebase itself knows about the currently authenticated user. If no user is authenticated in the first place, nothing will happen when calling this function.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=21" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignInWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignOut = () => this.auth.signOut();
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

Last but not least, there are two more authentication methods to reset and change a password of an authenticated user:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=23 25 26" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignInWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignOut = () => this.auth.signOut();

  doPasswordReset = email => this.auth.sendPasswordResetEmail(email);

  doPasswordUpdate = password =>
    this.auth.currentUser.updatePassword(password);
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

That's it for the whole authentication interface for your React components to be connected to the Firebase API. It covers all the use cases for the purpose of this application. In the next sections, you are going to consume all the methods of your Firebase class in your React components.

### Exercises:

* Read more about {{% a_blank "Firebase Authentication for Web" "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start" %}}
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/ad71eae018fa27202fd1a42da0e624805068800e" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Sign Up with React and Firebase" "react-firebase-sign-up" %}}

In the previous sections, you have set up all the routes for your application, configured Firebase and implemented the authentication API for your Firebase class. Now it is about time to use the authentication functionalities in your React components. Let's build the components from scratch. I try to put most of the code in one block at this point, because the components are not too small and splitting them up step by step could be too verbose. Nevertheless, I will guide you through each code block afterward. At some point, the code blocks for forms can become repetitive. Thus, they will be explained once well enough in the beginning, but later in a similar version reused.

Let's start with the sign up page (registration page). It consists of the page, a form, and a link. Whereas the form is used to sign up a new user to your application, the link will be used on the sign in page (login page) if a user has no account yet. It is only a redirect to the sign up page then, but not used on the sign up page itself. Implement the *src/components/SignUp/index.js* file the following way:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const SignUpPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SignUp</h1>
    <SignUpForm />
  </div>
);

class SignUpForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  onSubmit = event => {

  }

  onChange = event => {

  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>

      </form>
    );
  }
}

const SignUpLink = () => (
  <p>
    Don't have an account? <Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_UP}>Sign Up</Link>
  </p>
);

export default SignUpPage;

export { SignUpForm, SignUpLink };
{{< /highlight >}}

Let's focus on the SignUpForm component. It is the only React class component in this file, because it has to manage the form state in React's local state. There are two pieces missing in the current SignUpForm component: the form content in the render method in terms of input fields to capture the information (email address, password, etc.) of a user and the implementation of the `onSubmit` class method when a user signs up eventually.

First, let's initialize the state of the component. It will capture the user information such as username, email, and password. There will be a second password field/state for a password confirmation. In addition, there is an error state to capture an error object in case of the sign up request to the Firebase API fails. The state is initialized by an object destructuring. By doing it this way, we can use the initial state object later to reset the state after a successful sign up.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 4 5 6 7 8 9 15" >}}
...

const INITIAL_STATE = {
  username: '',
  email: '',
  passwordOne: '',
  passwordTwo: '',
  error: null,
};

class SignUpForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { ...INITIAL_STATE };
  }

  ...

}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, let's implement all the input fields to capture those information in the render method of the component. The input fields need to update the local state of the component by using a `onChange` handler.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=7 8 9 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52" >}}
...

class SignUpForm extends Component {

  ...

  onChange = event => {
    this.setState({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };

  render() {
    const {
      username,
      email,
      passwordOne,
      passwordTwo,
      error,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input
          name="username"
          value={username}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="text"
          placeholder="Full Name"
        />
        <input
          name="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="text"
          placeholder="Email Address"
        />
        <input
          name="passwordOne"
          value={passwordOne}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="password"
          placeholder="Password"
        />
        <input
          name="passwordTwo"
          value={passwordTwo}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="password"
          placeholder="Confirm Password"
        />
        <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>

        {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    );
  }
}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

Let's take the last implemented code block apart. All the input fields implement the unidirectional data flow of React. Thus each input field gets a value from the local state and updates the value in the local state with a `onChange` handler. The input fields are controlled by the local state of the component and don't control their own states. They are controlled components.

In the last part of the form, there is an optional error message that is used from an error object. The error objects from Firebase have this message property by nature, so you can rely on it to display a proper text for your application's user. However, the message is only shown when there is an actual error by using a [conditional rendering](https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react/).

One piece in the form is missing: validation. Let's use a `isInvalid` boolean to enable or disable the submit button. When you think about a validation condition for the form, what would it be?

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=16 17 18 19 20 26" >}}
...

class SignUpForm extends Component {

  ...

  render() {
    const {
      username,
      email,
      passwordOne,
      passwordTwo,
      error,
    } = this.state;

    const isInvalid =
      passwordOne !== passwordTwo ||
      passwordOne === '' ||
      email === '' ||
      username === '';

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input
        ...
        <button disabled={isInvalid} type="submit">
          Sign Up
        </button>

        {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    );
  }
}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

The user is only allowed to sign up if both passwords are the same (password confirmation in a common sign up process) and if the username, email and at least one password are filled with a string.

You should be able to visit the */signup* route in your browser after starting your application to confirm that the form with all its input fields shows up. Furthermore, you should be able to type into it (confirmation that the local state updates are working) and you should be able to enable the submit button by providing all input fields a string (confirmation that the validation works).

What's missing in the component is the `onSubmit()` class method which will pass all the form data to the Firebase authentication API via your previously implemented authentication interface in the Firebase class.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19" >}}
...

class SignUpForm extends Component {

  ...

  onSubmit = event => {
    const { username, email, passwordOne } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, passwordOne)
      .then(authUser => {
        this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  };

  ...
}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

The code is not working yet, but let's break down what we have so far. All the necessary information that is passed to the authentication API can be destructured from the local state. You will only need one password property, because both password strings should be the same after the validation anyway.

Next, you can call the sign up function which you have defined in the previous section in the Firebase class. It takes the email and the password property. The username is not used yet for the sign up process, but will be used in a later section.

If the request resolves successfully, you can set the local state of the component to its initial state to empty the input fields. If the request is rejected, you will run into the catch block and set the error object in the local state. Thus an error message should show up in the form due to the conditional rendering in your component's render method.

In addition, the `preventDefault()` method on the event prevents a reload of the browser which otherwise would be a natural behavior when using a submit in a form. Moreover, note that the signed up user object from the Firebase API is available in the callback function of the then block in our request. You will use it later with the username.

You may have noticed that one essential piece is missing: We didn't make the Firebase instance available in the SignUpForm [component's props](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component/) yet. Let's change this by utilizing our Firebase Context in the SignUpPage component and by passing the Firebase instance to the SignUpForm.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=4 10 11 12" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import { FirebaseContext } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const SignUpPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SignUp</h1>
    <FirebaseContext.Consumer>
      {firebase => <SignUpForm firebase={firebase} />}
    </FirebaseContext.Consumer>
  </div>
);

const INITIAL_STATE = { ... };

class SignUpForm extends Component {
  ...
}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

Now the registration of a new user should work. However, I'd like to make one improvement on how we access the Firebase instance here. Rather than having a [render prop component](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props-pattern/), which is automatically given with React's Context Consumer component, it may be simpler in the future to use a [higher-order component](https://www.robinwieruch.de/gentle-introduction-higher-order-components/). Let's implement this higher-order component in the *src/components/Firebase/context.js*:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=5 6 7 8 9" >}}
import React from 'react';

const FirebaseContext = React.createContext(null);

export const withFirebase = Component => props => (
  <FirebaseContext.Consumer>
    {firebase => <Component {...props} firebase={firebase} />}
  </FirebaseContext.Consumer>
);

export default FirebaseContext;
{{< /highlight >}}

Next make it available via our Firebase module in the *src/components/Firebase/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=1 6" >}}
import FirebaseContext, { withFirebase } from './context';
import Firebase from './firebase';

export default Firebase;

export { FirebaseContext, withFirebase };
{{< /highlight >}}

Now, instead of using the Firebase Context directly in the SignUpPage, which doesn't need to know about the Firebase instance in the first place, use the higher-order component to wrap your SignUpForm. Afterward, the SignUpForm has access to the Firebase instance via the higher-order component. Then it's also possible to use the SignUpForm as standalone without the SignUpPage, because it is responsible to get the Firebase instance via the higher-order component.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=4 10 16 22" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const SignUpPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SignUp</h1>
    <SignUpForm />
  </div>
);

const INITIAL_STATE = { ... };

class SignUpFormBase extends Component {
  ...
}

const SignUpLink = () => ...

const SignUpForm = withFirebase(SignUpFormBase);

export default SignUpPage;

export { SignUpForm, SignUpLink };
{{< /highlight >}}

So what's next? When a user signs up to your application, you want to redirect the user to another page. Perhaps it should be the Home page of the user which will be a protected route for only authenticated users at some point. Therefore, you will need the help of React Router to redirect the user after a successful sign up.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 20 34" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

...

class SignUpForm extends Component {

  ...

  onSubmit = (event) => {
    const { username, email, passwordOne } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, passwordOne)
      .then(authUser => {
        this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
        this.props.history.push(ROUTES.HOME);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  }

  ...
}

...

const SignUpForm = withRouter(withFirebase(SignUpFormBase));

export default SignUpPage;

export { SignUpForm, SignUpLink };
{{< /highlight >}}

Let's take the previous code block apart again. In order to redirect a user to another page programmatically, we need access to React Router. Somehow it needs to be possible to tell React Router that it should redirect the user to another page.

Fortunately, the React Router node package offers a neat higher-order component to make the router properties accessible in the props of a component. Any component which goes in the `withRouter()` higher-order component gets access to all the properties of the router. Thus when passing the already enhanced SignUpFormBase component to the `withRouter()` higher-order component, it has access to the props of the router. The relevant property for us from the router props is the `history` object, because it enables us to redirect a user to another page by pushing a route to it.

Eventually, the history object of the router can be used in the `onSubmit()` class method. If a request resolves successfully, you can push any route to the history object. Since the pushed */home* route is defined in our App component with a matching component to be rendered, the displayed page component will change after the redirect.

There is one improvement that we can make for the higher-order components used for the SignUpForm. Nesting functions (higher-order components) into each other like we did before can become verbose. A neat way would be to compose the higher-order components instead. Therefore, install {{% a_blank "recompose" "https://github.com/acdlite/recompose" %}} for your application on the command line:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
npm install recompose
{{< /highlight >}}

Then use it for composing your higher-order components. Since the higher-order components don't depend on each other, the order doesn't matter. Otherwise it may be good to know that the compose function applies the higher-order components from right to left.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 10 11 12 13" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { compose } from 'recompose';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

...

const SignUpForm = compose(
  withRouter,
  withFirebase,
)(SignUpFormBase);

export default SignUpPage;

export { SignUpForm, SignUpLink };
{{< /highlight >}}

You can run your application now and checkout if the sign up process works for you. If you signed up a user successfully, you should be redirected to the home page. If the sign up fails, you should see an error message. Try to sign up a user with the same email address twice and verify that the following or a similar error message shows up: "The email address is already in use by another account.". Congratulations, you signed up your first user via Firebase authentication.

{{% chapter_header "Sign In with React and Firebase" "react-firebase-sign-in" %}}

A sign up automatically results into a sign in (login) of a user. That's something you will notice later eventually. However, of course, we cannot rely on it, because a user could already be signed up but not signed in to our application. Let's implement the login with Firebase now. It is similar to the sign up mechanism and components, so this time I will not split it up into too many code blocks. Implement the *src/components/SignIn/index.js* file the following way:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { compose } from 'recompose';

import { SignUpLink } from '../SignUp';
import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const SignInPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SignIn</h1>
    <SignInForm />
    <SignUpLink />
  </div>
);

const INITIAL_STATE = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  error: null,
};

class SignInFormBase extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { ...INITIAL_STATE };
  }

  onSubmit = event => {
    const { email, password } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doSignInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
      .then(() => {
        this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
        this.props.history.push(ROUTES.HOME);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  };

  onChange = event => {
    this.setState({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };

  render() {
    const { email, password, error } = this.state;

    const isInvalid = password === '' || email === '';

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input
          name="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="text"
          placeholder="Email Address"
        />
        <input
          name="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="password"
          placeholder="Password"
        />
        <button disabled={isInvalid} type="submit">
          Sign In
        </button>

        {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    );
  }
}

const SignInForm = compose(
  withRouter,
  withFirebase,
)(SignInFormBase);

export default SignInPage;

export { SignInForm };
{{< /highlight >}}

Basically, it is almost the same as the sign up form. The form with its input fields captures all the necessary information such as username and password. A validation step makes sure that email and password are set before performing the request by enabling or disabling the submit button. The authentication API is used again, but this time with the function to sign in a user rather than the function to sign up a user. If the sign in succeeds, the local state is updated with the initial state and the user is redirected again. If the sign in fails, an error object is stored in the local state and an error message should show up. There is one difference though: The SignUpLink,  which you have defined earlier in the SignUp module, is used on the sign in page. It gives the user a way to sign up if the user hasn't an account yet but happens to be on the sign in page.

### Exercises:

* Get comfortable with the SignIn and SignInForm components
  * If they are mysterious to you, checkout the previous section with the implementation of the SignUpForm again
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/commit/6cbccce21952e10472504fc6ef3d37af2c998bb6" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Sign Out with React and Firebase" "react-firebase-sign-out" %}}

In order to complete the authentication loop, let's implement as last part the sign out component. It doesn't need any form and is only a button which shows up in the Navigation component. Since we can use the already defined authentication API to sign out a user, it is fairly straight forward to pass the functionality to a button in a React component. Implement the SignOut in the *src/components/SignOut/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';

const SignOutButton = ({ firebase }) => (
  <button type="button" onClick={firebase.doSignOut}>
    Sign Out
  </button>
);

export default withFirebase(SignOutButton);
{{< /highlight >}}

The SignOut button has access to the Firebase instance by utilizing the higher-order component again. Now, use the SignOut button in the Navigation component in your *src/components/Navigation/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=4 25 26 27" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import SignOutButton from '../SignOut';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const Navigation = () => (
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_IN}>Sign In</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.LANDING}>Landing</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.HOME}>Home</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.ACCOUNT}>Account</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to={ROUTES.ADMIN}>Admin</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <SignOutButton />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default Navigation;
{{< /highlight >}}

Component perspective-wise, everything is in place to fulfil a full authentication roundtrip now. A user is able to sign up (register), sign in (login) and sign out (logout).

### Exercises:

* Read more about {{% a_blank "Firebase Authentication with E-Mail/Password" "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth" %}}
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/5cef7624455f585df4af38f6e04b6d418d82a388" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Session Handling with Firebase/React" "react-firebase-session-handling" %}}

This section is the most important one for the overarching authentication process. You have all components in place to fulfil the authentication roundtrip in React components, but no greater entity knows about any session state yet. The question that needs to be answered: "Is there a currently authenticated user?" There is no logic about it, but the information needs to be stored somewhere to make it accessible to other components.

Often that's the point where people start to use a state management library such as [Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/). We can get around it by using [global state](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-global-state-without-redux/) without any of these state management libraries. Since our whole application is put together under the umbrella App component, it's sufficient to manage the session state in the App component by using React's local state there. The App component only needs to keep track of an authenticated user (session). If a user is authenticated, store it in the local state and pass the authenticated user object down to all components that are interested in it. Otherwise, pass the authenticated user down as `null`. That way, all components interested in it can adjust their behavior (e.g. use conditional rendering) based on the session state. For instance, the Navigation component is interested in it, because it has to show different options to authenticated and non authenticated users (e.g. the SignOut component shouldn't show up for a non authenticated user).

Let's start to implement the session handling in the App component in the *src/components/App/index.js* file. Because the component handles local state now, you have to refactor it to a class component. It manages the local state of a `authUser` object, where we don't know yet where it comes from, and passes it to the Navigation component.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=1 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 19 26 27 28" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

...

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      authUser: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <div>
          <Navigation authUser={this.state.authUser} />

          <hr/>

          ...
        </div>
      </Router>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
{{< /highlight >}}

The Navigation component can be made aware of authenticated user now to display different options depending on it. It should either show the available links for an authenticated user or a non authenticated user.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import SignOutButton from '../SignOut';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const Navigation = ({ authUser }) => (
  <div>{authUser ? <NavigationAuth /> : <NavigationNonAuth />}</div>
);

const NavigationAuth = () => (
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.LANDING}>Landing</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.HOME}>Home</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.ACCOUNT}>Account</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <SignOutButton />
    </li>
  </ul>
);

const NavigationNonAuth = () => (
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.LANDING}>Landing</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_IN}>Sign In</Link>
    </li>
  </ul>
);

export default Navigation;
{{< /highlight >}}

Let's see where the `authUser` (authenticated user) comes from in the App component. Firebase offers a listener function to get the authenticated user from Firebase:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=4 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 27" >}}
...

import * as ROUTES from '../constants/routes';
import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      authUser: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.firebase.auth.onAuthStateChanged(authUser => {
      authUser
        ? this.setState({ authUser })
        : this.setState({ authUser: null });
    });
  }

  ...

}

export default withFirebase(App);
{{< /highlight >}}

The helper function `onAuthStateChanged()` receives a function as parameter which has access to the authenticated user. In addition, this passed function is called every time something changed for the authenticated user. It is called when a user signs up (because it results in a sign in), signs in and signs out. If a user signs out, the `authUser` object becomes null. Thus the `authUser` property in the local state is set to null and as reaction all components depending on it can adjust their behavior (e.g. display different options like the Navigation component).

We want to avoid to run into memory leaks which can lead to [performance issues](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-warning-cant-call-setstate-on-an-unmounted-component/), that's why we need to remove the listener in case the component unmounts.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=7 16 17 18" >}}
...

class App extends Component {
  ...

  componentDidMount() {
    this.listener = this.props.firebase.auth.onAuthStateChanged(
      authUser => {
        authUser
          ? this.setState({ authUser })
          : this.setState({ authUser: null });
      },
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.listener();
  }

  ...

}

export default withFirebase(App);
{{< /highlight >}}

Start your application again and verify that your sign up, sign in and sign out works properly and that the Navigation components displays the options depending on the session state (authenticated user) accordingly.

That's it, you have successfully implemented the authentication process with Firebase in React. Everything that comes in the following sections is extra implementation on top to improve the developer experience and a couple of neat features along the way.

### Exercises:

* Read more about {{% a_blank "Firebase's Authenticated User" "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users" %}}
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/8fa558878fa5c7e7bbb905c0c12b592cbfd69e3d" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Session Handling with Higher-Order Components" "react-firebase-session-handling-higher-order-components" %}}

A basic version of the session handling was implemented in the last section. However, at the moment, the authenticated user needs to be passed down from the App component to all components which are interested in it. That becomes tedious over time, because the authenticated user has to be passed through all components until it reaches all the component in the leaf components. You have used the React Context API before to pass down the Firebase instance to any component. Here you will do the same for the authenticated user. In a new *src/components/Session/context.js* file, implement the following new React Context for the session (authenticated user):

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

const AuthUserContext = React.createContext(null);

export default AuthUserContext;
{{< /highlight >}}

Next import and export it from the *src/components/Session/index.js* file that is entry point to this module:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import AuthUserContext from './context';

export { AuthUserContext };
{{< /highlight >}}

Now the App component can use the new context for providing the authenticated user to all other components that are interested in it:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 10 13 20" >}}
...

import { AuthUserContext } from '../Session';

class App extends Component {
  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <AuthUserContext.Provider value={this.state.authUser}>
        <Router>
          <div>
            <Navigation />

            <hr />

            ...
          </div>
        </Router>
      </AuthUserContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

export default withFirebase(App);
{{< /highlight >}}

The `authUser` doesn't need to be passed to the Navigation component anymore. Instead, the Navigation component can use the new context to consume the authenticated user:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 5 7 8 9 10 11" >}}
...

import { AuthUserContext } from '../Session';

const Navigation = () => (
  <div>
    <AuthUserContext.Consumer>
      {authUser =>
        authUser ? <NavigationAuth /> : <NavigationNonAuth />
      }
    </AuthUserContext.Consumer>
  </div>
);
{{< /highlight >}}

The application should still work as before, but now any component can simply use React's Context to consume the authenticated user. In order to keep the App component clean and concise, I would like to extract the session handling functionalities for the authenticated user to a separate higher-order component in a new *src/components/Session/withAuthentication.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

const withAuthentication = Component => {
  class WithAuthentication extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <Component {...this.props} />;
    }
  }

  return WithAuthentication;
};

export default withAuthentication;
{{< /highlight >}}

Move all logic that deals with the authenticated user from the App component to it:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 4 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 31 32 33 34 35 39" >}}
import React from 'react';

import AuthUserContext from './context';
import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';

const withAuthentication = Component => {
  class WithAuthentication extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
        authUser: null,
      };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      this.listener = this.props.firebase.auth.onAuthStateChanged(
        authUser => {
          authUser
            ? this.setState({ authUser })
            : this.setState({ authUser: null });
        },
      );
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      this.listener();
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <AuthUserContext.Provider value={this.state.authUser}>
          <Component {...this.props} />
        </AuthUserContext.Provider>
      );
    }
  }

  return withFirebase(WithAuthentication);
};

export default withAuthentication;
{{< /highlight >}}

As you can see, it also uses the new React Context to provide the authenticated user again. The App component itself will not be in charge of it anymore. Next, don't forget to export the higher-order component from the *src/components/Session/index.js* file, so that it can be used in the App component afterward:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 4" >}}
import AuthUserContext from './context';
import withAuthentication from './withAuthentication';

export { AuthUserContext, withAuthentication };
{{< /highlight >}}

The App component becomes a function component again without the additional business logic for the authenticated user. Now it uses the higher-order component to make the authenticated user available for all other components that are below of the App component:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=1 14 16 36 38" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

import Navigation from '../Navigation';
import LandingPage from '../Landing';
import SignUpPage from '../SignUp';
import SignInPage from '../SignIn';
import PasswordForgetPage from '../PasswordForget';
import HomePage from '../Home';
import AccountPage from '../Account';
import AdminPage from '../Admin';

import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';
import { withAuthentication } from '../Session';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <Navigation />

      <hr />

      <Route exact path={ROUTES.LANDING} component={LandingPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.SIGN_UP} component={SignUpPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.SIGN_IN} component={SignInPage} />
      <Route
        exact
        path={ROUTES.PASSWORD_FORGET}
        component={PasswordForgetPage}
      />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.HOME} component={HomePage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.ACCOUNT} component={AccountPage} />
      <Route exact path={ROUTES.ADMIN} component={AdminPage} />
    </div>
  </Router>
);

export default withAuthentication(App);
{{< /highlight >}}

Now, start your application again and verify that it still works the same as before. You didn't change any behavior of your application in this section, but only shielded away the more complex logic into a higher-order component and added the convenience of passing the authenticated user implicitly via React's Context rather than explicitly through the whole component tree by using props.

### Exercises:

* Get comfortable what you have done in the last section
  * Check again your Firebase Context and higher-order component implementation in the *src/components/Firebase* module which is quite similar to what you have done in this section
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/b329f6e5fb4a388e131fe1c26f0a6fdcc3fd2e83" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Password Reset and Password Change with Firebase" "react-firebase-password" %}}

Let's take a step back from all the higher-order components, React Context API and the session handling. In this section, we are going to implement two additional features that are available in the Firebase authentication API. In the beginning, you have already implemented the interface in your Firebase class: it's the ability to retrieve a new password (password forget) and to change a password.

{{% sub_chapter_header "Password Forget" "firebase-password-forget" %}}

Let's start by implementing the password forget feature. Since you have  already implemented the interface in your Firebase class, you can make use of it in a component. The following file implements the vast majority of the password reset logic in a form again. We already implemented a couple of those forms before, so it shouldn't be any different now. Implement it the follow way in the *src/components/PasswordForget/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const PasswordForgetPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>PasswordForget</h1>
    <PasswordForgetForm />
  </div>
);

const INITIAL_STATE = {
  email: '',
  error: null,
};

class PasswordForgetFormBase extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { ...INITIAL_STATE };
  }

  onSubmit = event => {
    const { email } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doPasswordReset(email)
      .then(() => {
        this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  };

  onChange = event => {
    this.setState({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };

  render() {
    const { email, error } = this.state;

    const isInvalid = email === '';

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input
          name="email"
          value={this.state.email}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="text"
          placeholder="Email Address"
        />
        <button disabled={isInvalid} type="submit">
          Reset My Password
        </button>

        {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    );
  }
}

const PasswordForgetLink = () => (
  <p>
    <Link to={ROUTES.PASSWORD_FORGET}>Forgot Password?</Link>
  </p>
);

export default PasswordForgetPage;

const PasswordForgetForm = withFirebase(PasswordForgetFormBase);

export { PasswordForgetForm, PasswordForgetLink };
{{< /highlight >}}

Again it's a lot of code. But it isn't any different from the sign up and sign in forms from previous sections. The password forget uses a form to submit the information (only email address) which is needed by the Firebase authentication API to reset the password. A class method (onSubmit) makes sure that the information is send to the API. Furthermore, it resets the form's input field on a successful request or shows an error on an erroneous request. In addition, the form is validated as well before it can be submitted.

Moreover, the file implements a password forget link as a component which isn't used directly in the form component. It is similar to the SignUpLink component which was used on in the SignInPage component. This link is not different and you can already make use of it. In case a user forgot about the password after the sign up process, the password forget page isn't far away by using the link in the *src/components/SignIn/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=6 14" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { compose } from 'recompose';

import { SignUpLink } from '../SignUp';
import { PasswordForgetLink } from '../PasswordForget';
import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const SignInPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>SignIn</h1>
    <SignInForm />
    <PasswordForgetLink />
    <SignUpLink />
  </div>
);


...
{{< /highlight >}}

The password forget page is already matched in the App component. That's why you can simply drop the PasswordForgetLink component in the sign in page and know that the mapping between route and component is already set up.

You can try it out yourself now. Start the application and reset your password. It doesn't matter if you are authenticated or not. Once you send the request, you should get an email from Firebase to update your password.

{{% sub_chapter_header "Password Change" "firebase-password-change" %}}

Now let's get to the second feature implemented as React component: the password change feature. You have implemented this functionality already in your Firebase interface as well. You only need a form component to make use of it. Again, the form component isn't any different from the sign in, sign up and password forget forms. In the *src/components/PasswordChange/index.js* file implement the following component:

{{< highlight javascript >}}

import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';

const INITIAL_STATE = {
  passwordOne: '',
  passwordTwo: '',
  error: null,
};

class PasswordChangeForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { ...INITIAL_STATE };
  }

  onSubmit = event => {
    const { passwordOne } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doPasswordUpdate(passwordOne)
      .then(() => {
        this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  };

  onChange = event => {
    this.setState({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value });
  };

  render() {
    const { passwordOne, passwordTwo, error } = this.state;

    const isInvalid =
      passwordOne !== passwordTwo || passwordOne === '';

    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input
          name="passwordOne"
          value={passwordOne}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="password"
          placeholder="New Password"
        />
        <input
          name="passwordTwo"
          value={passwordTwo}
          onChange={this.onChange}
          type="password"
          placeholder="Confirm New Password"
        />
        <button disabled={isInvalid} type="submit">
          Reset My Password
        </button>

        {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default withFirebase(PasswordChangeForm);
{{< /highlight >}}

The component updates its local state by using `onChange` handlers in the input fields. Furthermore, it validates the state before submitting a request to change the password by enabling or disabling the submit button. Last but not least, it shows again an error message when a request fails.

So far, the PasswordChangeForm is not matched by any route, because it should live on the Account page instead. The Account page could be the central place for users to manage their accounts whereas it shows the PasswordChangeForm but also the PasswordResetForm even though the latter feature is accessible by a standalone route too. You have already created the *src/components/Account/index.js* file and matched the route in the App component. Now you only need to implement it:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

import { PasswordForgetForm } from '../PasswordForget';
import PasswordChangeForm from '../PasswordChange';

const AccountPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Account: {authUser.email}</h1>
    <PasswordForgetForm />
    <PasswordChangeForm />
  </div>
);

export default AccountPage;

The Account page doesn't have any business logic. It merely uses the password forget and password change forms in a central place.

In this section, your user experience has improved significantly with the password forget and password change features. Users who have trouble with their passwords can use these features now.

### Exercises:

* Think about ways on how to protect the Account page as only being accessible by authenticated users
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/a644850ef10121c5c97e4dd2dc22c62101b9f8b0" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Protected Routes in React with Authorization" "react-firebase-protected-routes" %}}

When you sign out while being on the home or account page, you will not get any redirect even though these pages should be only accessible for authenticated users. However, it makes no sense to show a non authenticated user the account or home page. In this section, you will implement a protection for these routes in case a user signs out which is called authorization.

The protection you are going to implement is a **broad-grained authorization** for your application. It checks whether there is an authenticated user. If there isn't an authenticated user, it will redirect from a protected to a public route. Otherwise, it will do nothing. The condition could be defined as:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
const condition = authUser => authUser != null;

// short version
const condition = authUser => !!authUser;
{{< /highlight >}}

In contrast, a more **fine-grained authorization** could be a role-based or permission-based authorization:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
// role-based authorization
const condition = authUser => authUser.role === 'ADMIN';

// permission-based authorization
const condition = authUser => authUser.permissions.canEditAccount;
{{< /highlight >}}

Fortunately, we will implement it in a way that you can define the authorization condition (predicate) in a flexible way. You are in charge of using a more general authorization rule, permission-based or role-based authorizations.

Similar to the `withAuthentication` higher-order component, there will be a `withAuthorization` higher-order component to shield away the authorization business logic from your components. It can be used on any component (mostly page components) that need to be protected with authorization (e.g. home page, account page). Let's start to implement the higher-order component in a new *src/components/Session/withAuthorization.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

const withAuthorization = () => Component => {
  class WithAuthorization extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <Component {...this.props} />;
    }
  }

  return WithAuthorization;
};

export default withAuthorization;
{{< /highlight >}}

What's the task of the higher-order component? First of all, it gets a condition function passed as parameter. That way, you can decide on your own if it should be a broad-grained or fine-grained (role-based, permission-based) authorization rule. Second, it has to decide based on the condition whether it should redirect to a public page (public route), because the user isn't authorized to view the current protected page (protected route). Let's paste the implementation details for the higher-order component and go through it step by step afterward:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=2 3 5 6 8 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 31 32 33 34" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { compose } from 'recompose';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const withAuthorization = condition => Component => {
  class WithAuthorization extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      this.listener = this.props.firebase.auth.onAuthStateChanged(
        authUser => {
          if (!condition(authUser)) {
            this.props.history.push(ROUTES.SIGN_IN);
          }
        },
      );
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      this.listener();
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <Component {...this.props} />
      );
    }
  }

  return compose(
    withRouter,
    withFirebase,
  )(WithAuthorization);
};

export default withAuthorization;
{{< /highlight >}}

The render method displays the passed component (e.g. home page, account page) that should be protected by this higher-order component. We will refine this later. The real authorization logic happens in the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. Identical to the `withAuthentication()` higher-order component, it uses the Firebase listener to trigger a callback function every time the authenticated user changes. The authenticated user is either a `authUser` object or `null`. Within this function, the passed `condition()` function is executed with the `authUser`. If the authorization fails, for instance because the authenticated user is `null`, the higher-order component redirects to the sign in page. If it doesn't fail, the higher-order component does nothing and simply renders the passed component (e.g. home page, account page). In order to be able to redirect a user, the higher-order component has access to the history object of the Router by using the in-house `withRouter()` higher-order component from the React Router library.

Don't forget to export the higher-order component from your session module in the *src/components/Sessions/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 5" >}}
import AuthUserContext from './context';
import withAuthentication from './withAuthentication';
import withAuthorization from './withAuthorization';

export { AuthUserContext, withAuthentication, withAuthorization };
{{< /highlight >}}

In the next step, you can use the higher-order component to protect your routes (e.g. /home and /account) with authorization rules by using the passed `condition()` function. For the sake of keeping it simple, the following two components are only protected with a broad-grained authorization rule that checks if the `authUser` is not `null`. First, enhance the HomePage component with the higher-order component and define the authorization condition for it:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 8 12 14" >}}
import React from 'react';

import { withAuthorization } from '../Session';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    <p>The Home Page is accessible by every signed in user.</p>
  </div>
);

const condition = authUser => !!authUser;

export default withAuthorization(condition)(HomePage);
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, enhance the AccountPage component with the higher-order component and define the authorization condition as well. It isn't much different from the previous usage:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=5 15 17" >}}
import React from 'react';

import { PasswordForgetForm } from '../PasswordForget';
import PasswordChangeForm from '../PasswordChange';
import { withAuthorization } from '../Session';

const AccountPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Account Page</h1>
    <PasswordForgetForm />
    <PasswordChangeForm />
  </div>
);

const condition = authUser => !!authUser;

export default withAuthorization(condition)(AccountPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

The protection of both pages/routes is almost done. One refinement can be made in the `withAuthorization` higher-order component by using the authenticated user from the context:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=5 25 26 27 28 29" >}}
import React from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { compose } from 'recompose';

import AuthUserContext from './context';
import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';
import * as ROUTES from '../../constants/routes';

const withAuthorization = condition => Component => {
  class WithAuthorization extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      this.listener = firebase.auth.onAuthStateChanged(authUser => {
        if (!authCondition(authUser)) {
          this.props.history.push(ROUTES.SIGN_IN);
        }
      });
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      this.listener();
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <AuthUserContext.Consumer>
          {authUser =>
            condition(authUser) ? <Component {...this.props} /> : null
          }
        </AuthUserContext.Consumer>
      );
    }
  }

  return compose(
    withRouter,
    withFirebase,
  )(WithAuthorization);
};

export default withAuthorization;
{{< /highlight >}}

The improvement in the render method was necessary to avoid showing the protected page before a redirect happens. You want to show nothing if the authenticated user doesn't meet the condition's criteria. If the listener is too late to redirect the user, it doesn't have to worry, because the higher-order component didn't show the protected component in the first place.

Both routes are protected now. That's why could render properties of the authenticated user in the AccountPage component without having a null check for the authenticated user in place. You know that the user should be there, otherwise the higher-order component would redirect to a public route.

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 9 10 12 16 17" >}}
import React from 'react';

import { AuthUserContext } from '../Session';
import { PasswordForgetForm } from '../PasswordForget';
import PasswordChangeForm from '../PasswordChange';
import { withAuthorization } from '../Session';

const AccountPage = () => (
  <AuthUserContext.Consumer>
    {authUser => (
      <div>
        <h1>Account: {authUser.email}</h1>
        <PasswordForgetForm />
        <PasswordChangeForm />
      </div>
    )}
  </AuthUserContext.Consumer>
);

const authCondition = authUser => !!authUser;

export default withAuthorization(authCondition)(AccountPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

You can try it yourself by signing out from your application and trying to access the */account* or */home* routes of your application. Both should redirect you to the */signin* route. Also when you stay on one of the routes, it should redirect you automatically.

I guess you can imagine how this technique gives you full control over your authorizations in your application. Not only by using broader authorization rules, but by being more specific with role-based and permission-based authorizations. For instance, an admin page, which is only available for users with the admin role, could be protected as follows:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import React from 'react';

import * as ROLES from '../../constants/roles';

const AdminPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Admin</h1>
    <p>
      Restricted area! Only users with the admin role are authorized.
    </p>
  </div>
);

const condition = authUser =>
  authUser && authUser.roles.includes(ROLES.ADMIN);

export default withAuthorization(condition)(AdminPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

We will implement such authorization later for this application. Congratulations, you have successfully implemented a full-fledged authentication mechanisms with Firebase in React, added neat features such as password reset and password change, and protected routes with dynamic authorization conditions.

### Exercises:

* Research yourself how a role-based or permission-based authorization could be implemented
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/94bb3a92970d4159564eb01bcfd24bcc0f8c4348" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Firebase Realtime Database in React" "react-firebase-realtime-database" %}}

So far, only Firebase knows about your users. There is no way to retrieve the single user or a list of users for you. They are stored internally by Firebase to keep the authentication secured. That's good, because you are never involved in storing sensible data like passwords. However, you can introduce the Firebase realtime database to keep track of the user entities yourself. And you should do it, because otherwise you never have a way to associate other domain entities (e.g. a message, book, invoice) created by your users to your users. Therefore, follow this section to store users in your realtime database in Firebase.

First, initialize the realtime database API for your Firebase class as you have done earlier for the authentication API:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 12" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';
import 'firebase/database';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
    this.db = app.database();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  ...
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, extend the interface for your Firebase class for the user entity. It defines two new functions: one to get a reference to a user by identifier (uid) and one to get a reference to all users:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=30 32 34" >}}
import app from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';
import 'firebase/database';

const config = { ... };

class Firebase {
  constructor() {
    app.initializeApp(config);

    this.auth = app.auth();
    this.db = app.database();
  }

  // *** Auth API ***

  doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignInWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) =>
    this.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

  doSignOut = () => this.auth.signOut();

  doPasswordReset = email => this.auth.sendPasswordResetEmail(email);

  doPasswordUpdate = password =>
    this.auth.currentUser.updatePassword(password);

  // *** User API ***

  user = uid => this.db.ref(`users/${uid}`);

  users = () => this.db.ref('users');
}

export default Firebase;
{{< /highlight >}}

The paths given in the `ref()` method match the location where your entities (users) will be stored in Firebase's realtime API. If you delete a user at "users/5", the user with the identifier 5 will be removed from the database. If you create a new user at "users", Firebase creates the identifier for you and assigns all the information you pass for the user. The paths follow the {{% a_blank "REST philosophy" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" %}} where every entity (e.g. user, message, book, author) is associated with a URI and HTTP methods are used to create, update, delete and get entities. In Firebase the RESTful URI becomes a simple path and the HTTP methods becomes Firebase's API as we will see in this section.

### Exercises:

* Read more about {{% a_blank "Firebase's realtime database setup for Web" "https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start" %}}
* Confirm your {{% a_blank "source code for the last section" "https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-firebase-authentication/tree/7709484f2a79d284d35317fe60c1a06ed74bfc82" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Manage Users with Firebase's Realtime Database in React" "react-firebase-realtime-database-user-management" %}}

Now, use these references in your React components to create and get users from Firebase's realtime database. Let's start with the user creation. The best place to do it would be the SignUpForm component. It is the most natural place to create a user in the database after the sign up that happens via the Firebase authentication API. Just add another API request to create a user when the user signed up was successful. In *src/components/SignUp/index.js* file:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30" >}}
...

class SignUpFormBase extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { ...INITIAL_STATE };
  }

  onSubmit = event => {
    const { username, email, passwordOne } = this.state;

    this.props.firebase
      .doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, passwordOne)
      .then(authUser => {

        // Create a user in your Firebase realtime database
        this.props.firebase
          .user(authUser.user.uid)
          .set({
            username,
            email,
          })
          .then(() => {
            this.setState({ ...INITIAL_STATE });
            this.props.history.push(ROUTES.HOME);
          })
          .catch(error => {
            this.setState({ error });
          });

      })
      .catch(error => {
        this.setState({ error });
      });

    event.preventDefault();
  };

  ...
}

...
{{< /highlight >}}

There are two important things happening for a new sign up via the submit handler:

* (1) It creates a user in Firebase's internal authentication database that is only limited accessible.
* (2) If (1) was successful, it creates a user in Firebase's realtime database that is accessible.

In order to create a user in Firebase's realtime database, it uses the previously created reference from the Firebase class by providing the identifier (uid) of the user from Firebase's authentication database. Then the `set()` method can be used to provide data for this entity which is allocated for "users/uid". Finally you are able to use the `username` as well to provide additional information about your user.

Note: It is fine to store user information in your own database. However, you should make sure not to store the password or any other sensible data of the user on your own. Firebase already deals with the authentication and thus there is no need to store the password in your database. There are a bunch of steps necessary to secure such sensible data (e.g. encryption). It would be a security risk to do it on your own, so don't do it if someone else already handles it for you.

After the second Firebase request that creates the user resolves successfully, the previous business logic takes place again: reset the local state and redirect to the home page. To verify that the user creation is working, retrieve all the users from the realtime database in one of your other components. The admin page may be a good choice for it, because later it can be used by admin users to manage the application-wide users. First, make the admin page available via your Navigation component:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=14 15 16" >}}
...

const NavigationAuth = () => (
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.LANDING}>Landing</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.HOME}>Home</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.ACCOUNT}>Account</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to={ROUTES.ADMIN}>Admin</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <SignOutButton />
    </li>
  </ul>
);

...
{{< /highlight >}}

Next, the AdminPage component's `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method in *src/components/Admin/index.js* is the perfect place to fetch users from your Firebase realtime database API:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=3 9 10 11 12 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 35" >}}
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { withFirebase } from '../Firebase';

class AdminPage extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      loading: false,
      users: {},
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ loading: true });

    this.props.firebase.users().on('value', snapshot => {
      this.setState({
        users: snapshot.val(),
        loading: false,
      });
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Admin</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default withFirebase(AdminPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

We are using the users reference from our Firebase class to attach a listener to it. The listener is called `on()` and receives a type and a callback function. Whereas the `on()` method registers a continuous listener that triggers every time something has changed, the `once()` method registers a listener that would be called only once. In this scenario, we are interested to keep the latest list of users though.

Since the users are an object and not a list when they are retrieved from the Firebase database, you have to restructure them as list (array) which makes it easier to display them later:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=9 17 19 20 21 22 25" >}}
...

class AdminPage extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      loading: false,
      users: [],
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ loading: true });

    this.props.firebase.users().on('value', snapshot => {
      const usersObject = snapshot.val();

      const usersList = Object.keys(usersObject).map(key => ({
        ...usersObject[key],
        uid: key,
      }));

      this.setState({
        users: usersList,
        loading: false,
      });
    });
  }

  ...
}

export default withFirebase(AdminPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

Don't forget to remove the listener to avoid memory leaks by using the same reference with the `off()` method:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=6 7 8" >}}
...

class AdminPage extends Component {
  ...

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.firebase.users().off();
  }

  ...
}

export default withFirebase(AdminPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

Finally, render your list of users in the AdminPage component or in a child component with a name of your choice:

{{< highlight javascript "hl_lines=13 15 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37" >}}
...

class AdminPage extends Component {
  ...

  render() {
    const { users, loading } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Admin</h1>

        {loading && <div>Loading ...</div>}

        <UserList users={users} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const UserList = ({ users }) => (
  <ul>
    {users.map(user => (
      <li key={user.uid}>
        <span>
          <strong>ID:</strong> {user.uid}
        </span>
        <span>
          <strong>E-Mail:</strong> {user.email}
        </span>
        <span>
          <strong>Username:</strong> {user.username}
        </span>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

export default withFirebase(AdminPage);
{{< /highlight >}}

That's it for the user management. You are in full control of your users now. It is possible to create a user, to get a user or to get a list of users from your realtime database. You decide whether this is a one time call to the Firebase realtime database or whether you want to continuously listen for updates too.

### Exercises:

{{% chapter_header "What's next?" "react-firebase-authentication-advanced" %}}

Everything essential is in place in terms of Firebase authentication and Firebase realtime database for user management. If you want to continue with this application on your own, I am curious what you will build on top of it. So let me know about! If you want to continue to follow this tutorial, {{% a_blank "subscribe to my Newsletter" "https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch" %}} where I will announce the launch of the complete Firebase in React book in the next month.

**What's else will be included in the book?**

* Users and Messages: Next to the user management, you will introduce a second entity for messages to your application. By having both entities, user and message, we can build a chat application together.

* Role-based Authorization: So far, you have only authorized your application on a broader level by checking for an authenticated user. In the book, you will learn how to assign roles to your users and how to give them additional privileges.

* Read and Write Operations: In the application, you have created a user and display a list of users with real-time capabilities. The book continuous with the usual delete and update operations to organize your users in the realtime database.

* Offline, Double Opt-In, Social Logins: The book adds further Firebase functionalities like offline capabilities, double opt-in sign ups and social sign ups/ins via third-parties such as Facebook or Google.

* Firebase Deployment: The final step in the book would be to deploy your application with Firebase. The books walks you through the process step by step to see your project finally online.

**What's may be included in the book?**

* Firestore: Firebase's Firestore is the new Firebase Realtime Database. In the book, I may show you a way to migrate to this new tech stack. Then it is up to you whether you want to use Firestore or Firebase's Realtime Database.

* Cloud Functions: If I can come up with an example on how to use Firebase Cloud Functions in this application, I will include it in the book too. So far, I have no idea what it could be, so if you have any idea, leave me a comment below.

* Tech Stack Walkthroughs: This application is only build with React and Firebase. But what about taking it on the next level to enable it for real businesses? That's where I want to show you how to migrate the project to Redux, MobX, Gatsby.js, or Next.js.

**What may be included in the complete course package?**

* Source Code: You will get access to variations of this application that will have additional tech:
  * Gatsby + Firebase
  * React + Redux + Firebase
  * Next.js + Firebase
  * React + MobX + Firebase
  * React + Semantic UI + Firebase

**Why should I consider Redux or MobX?** As you have seen, it works in just great with only React. So [if you don't have any good reason to introduce Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/), consider to keep it like this. Otherwise, checkout my other course {{% a_blank "Taming the State in React" "https://roadtoreact.com" %}} to learn everything about Redux or MobX to use one of them in this project.

That's it for this tutorial. If you want to learn more about React with Firebase, grab **The Road to React with Firebase** to continue this learning journey. Hopefully, this tutorial has helped you to implement your own authentication and authorization mechanism in React with Firebase. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please reach out to me. Again, if the tutorial didn't explain everything in detail, then it was because most those things are already covered in my {{% a_blank "(partly free) courses" "https://roadtoreact.com/" %}} and the other referenced articles. The tutorial builds up on top of these learning materials, so make sure to check them out to learn everything about React, Redux, and MobX.
